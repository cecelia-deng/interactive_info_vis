          <p><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is designed for people who want a calm and mindful way to feel the passing of time — perfect for meditation, yoga, or deep focus sessions. It visualizes time not through numbers, but through breathing rhythm.</p>

          <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a soft pink background that changes slightly by hour to create a soothing atmosphere. The circle “breathes” in and out using a sine function, representing time as natural motion. Subtle text shows “Inhale” or “Exhale” depending on the rhythm, and the current time appears softly in the center.</p>

          <p><strong>Future work:</strong> I plan to add gentle background sound and allow users to adjust the breathing speed by moving the mouse, turning it into a personalized meditation timer.</p>

          <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The Breathing Clock was inspired by the idea of mindfulness and calm presence. I wanted to move away from traditional ticking clocks and instead visualize time through the natural rhythm of breath. My early sketches focused on simple expansion and contraction, but after testing different speeds and colors, I realized that slower motion and soft transitions created a more relaxing effect. Peer feedback encouraged me to make the text more subtle and the background color more dynamic, which helped strengthen the meditative tone. Through this process, I learned that pacing and subtle visual feedback can strongly influence emotional response. The final design successfully conveys the idea of time as a living rhythm—something you can feel rather than count.</p>

          <h3 id="sk3-narrative-title">Water Wave Clock</h3>

          <p><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is inspired by the calm motion of ocean waves. It’s designed for people who want to visualize time as a continuous flow — a reminder that time moves smoothly rather than in sharp ticks.</p>

          <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used three horizontal wave lines to represent hours, minutes, and seconds, each moving at a different speed and amplitude. The soft blue colors suggest peace and continuity. Instead of showing numbers, the flowing lines create a rhythmic visual of passing time.</p>

          <p><strong>Future work:</strong> I plan to make the waves react to mouse movement — when the user moves the mouse, the waves could ripple more strongly, adding an interactive, playful touch to the calm design.</p>

          <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The design of the Water Wave Clock evolved through several iterations. My first sketch focused on the concept of smooth time flow using three simple wave lines. After receiving peer feedback, I realized the waves needed more visible variation to distinguish hours, minutes, and seconds, so I added moving dots and adjusted the amplitudes. In the final version, I refined the line motion and introduced softer gradients to enhance the calm, ocean-like feeling. This iterative process helped me balance clarity and aesthetics—too much motion looked chaotic, while too little felt static. Through this evolution, I learned how subtle visual changes can deeply affect how users feel the passage of time.</p>

          <h3 id="sk4-narrative-title">Gradient Ring Clock</h3>

          <p><strong>Context:</strong> This clock is designed for people who prefer a clear but artistic way to read time. It turns hours, minutes, and seconds into color and motion inside a circular form, showing time as a repeating cycle.</p>

          <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> The circle is divided into 12 segments for hours, with the active one highlighted. A small dot rotates along the ring to show seconds, while the inner gradient brightness reflects minutes. The ring layout symbolizes the repetitive yet smooth rhythm of daily life.</p>

          <p><strong>Future work:</strong> I’d like to experiment with color transitions that match daylight — cool tones in the morning and warm tones at night — and maybe add click interaction to change themes.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The Gradient Ring Clock was designed for cooking, visualizing how much time has passed and how much remains while preparing food. Instead of traditional countdown timers, this clock uses a circular gradient ring that gradually fills as time progresses. The warm-to-cool color transition mirrors the feeling of heat and completion during cooking. My early sketches focused on smooth rotation and subtle color change, but peer feedback encouraged me to make the progression more readable and purposeful. I refined the design so that each minute segment becomes part of the gradient’s continuous flow, helping users intuitively sense timing without reading numbers. Through this process, I learned how embedding time visualization in a familiar daily context—like cooking—can make abstract data feel practical and emotionally engaging.</p>
